Welcome to the GPGPU-Sim User Manual repository! This is a detailed document prepared for developers and researchers who use [GPGPU-Sim](https://github.com/accel-sim/gpgpu-sim_distribution.git) and are interested in GPU architecture and its simulation implementation. Unlike the [official manual](http://gpgpu-sim.org/manual/index.php/Main_Page), this manual focuses on code-level implementation details, providing users with resources to more easily get started with GPGPU-Sim.

[GPGPU-Sim](https://github.com/accel-sim/gpgpu-sim_distribution.git) is a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) simulator that allows users to simulate program execution in various Nvidia GPU architectures. It is a valuable tool for studying GPU performance optimization, architecture modifications, and parallel computing models.

## Features

Features of this repository include:

- **Detailed architecture description**: We provide in-depth analysis of various aspects of GPU architecture to help you understand its inner workings.

- **Code-level comments**: Through detailed comments on the GPGPU-Sim code base, we allow you to deeply understand the implementation details of the simulator.

- **Practical guides and examples**: To make it easier for you to get started with GPGPU-Sim, we provide practical usage guides and sample codes.

## Work Plan

This repository is still a work in progress, and future work plans include:

1. **Add more examples**: We plan to provide more practical examples to cover a wide range of use cases and simulation configurations.

2. **Update documentation**: As GPGPU-Sim itself is updated and GPU technology evolves, we will regularly update the documentation to reflect the latest technical advances and best practices.

3. **Community Contributions**: Community members are encouraged to contribute documentation and code comments to improve this manual together.

4. **Make an English version of the manual**: Recognizing the impact of the global community of GPU researchers and developers, we plan to create an English version of the manual to make it accessible to a wider audience.
